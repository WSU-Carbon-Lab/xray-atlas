## About X-Ray Atlas

X-Ray Atlas is an open platform for sharing, exploring, and analyzing NEXAFS/XANES spectroscopy data. It serves as a central repository for researchers to upload, search, and compare experimental data from various synchrotron facilities worldwide.

## Uploading Data

X-Ray Atlas simplifies the process of contributing spectroscopy data:

1. Fill out the data upload form with:
   - Molecule information (name, formula, structure)
   - Sample details (vendor, preparation method)
   - Experimental parameters (facility, beamline, edge, technique)
   - Researcher information

2. Upload your CSV data file containing:
   - Energy values (eV)
   - Intensity values (Âµ)
   - Angle information (theta, phi)

3. Submit the form to generate the necessary JSON files

4. Create a GitHub issue to complete the submission process

The platform handles data validation, normalization, and integration with the existing database.

## Repository Structure

- `src/app/_components`: React components for the web interface
- `src/server`: Server-side code for data processing and API endpoints

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the research community:

1. **Data Contributions**: Use the data upload form or submit a pull request with your spectroscopy data
2. **Code Contributions**: Help improve the platform's functionality, visualization tools, or user interface
3. **Documentation**: Enhance our guides, API documentation, or tutorials

Please check our [contributing guidelines](https://github.com/WSU-Carbon-Lab/xray-atlas/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details.

## Data Format

The database uses a structured JSON format that includes:

- Molecule metadata (name, formula, structure)
- Experiment details (facility, technique, edge)
- Spectroscopy data (energy, intensity, angle information)

Data is stored in individual molecule files and referenced in a central registry for efficient querying.

# REST API
There is an underying REST api that serves database content to the outside world uppon request. This is handeled by AWS and does 
accumulate a small charge based on the number of calls you make. If you are going to frequently use the same dataset for a calculation
we recommend downloading it through the website and working with the local copy. 

## Intended Programatic Interface
Identify the dataset from the website you want to work with on the website using the labeling information for a dataset
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6fab8491-eaa8-4834-85aa-311908d99e97)
Use this information to create the unique id for the dataset formatted as `{edge}_{method}_{facility}_{instrument}_{group}_{source}`. 
Using this data then load the dataset with pandas with the following code snippet. 

  ```python
  import pandas as pd
  df = pd.read_csv("https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/bucket/molecules/{molecule}/{uid}/csv")
  df.to_csv("local_csv.csv")
  # the rest of the stuff you want to do with the data
  ```
Alternately, download the file directly from the web page.

Programatic access of the database is funneled though an AWS API gateway application and invoked with this URL
```
https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod
```
The only HTTP method allowed is GET methods with no parameters. Here are the relevent methods

* Get all molecules `GET https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/bucket/molecules`
    * This returns a JSON object with all the header information for every molecule in the database
      ```JSON
      {
        "molecules": [ 
          "MOL1": {"name": "","synonyms": [""],"chemical_formula": "","description": "","SMILES": "","InChI": "","img": ""},
          "..."
        ]
      }
      ```
* Get metadata for a single molecule `GET https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/bucket/molecules/{molecule}/metadata`
    * This returns a JSON object with all the metadata for a single molecule. Including information about experiments
      ```JSON
      {
        "molecule": {
          "name": "","synonyms": [""],"chemical_formula": "","description": "","SMILES": "","InChI": "","img": "",
          "data": [
            {"edge": "","method": "","facility": "", "instrument": "", "group": "", "source": ""},
            "...",
          ]
        },
      }
      ```
* Get NEXAFS for a single experiment `GET https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/bucket/molecules/{molecule}/{uid}`
    * This returns a JSON object with the experiment details for a single experiment. The JSON data has a complex structure, and it is recommended to use the csv version instead
    * The UID is structured as `{edge}_{method}_{facility}_{instrument}_{group}_{source}`
* Get NEXAFS csv for a single experiment `GET https://bfsd0tdg6f.execute-api.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/prod/bucket/molecules/{molecule}/{uid}/csv`
    * This uses the same UID as before but returns a CSV instead
      ```csv
      Energy [{units}], mu, theta, phi
      270, .09, 30, 0,
      ```
