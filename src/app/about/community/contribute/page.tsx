          <h3>Fork the Repository</h3>
          <p>
            Once you're ready to start coding, create your own fork of the Xray
            Atlas repository. This gives you a personal copy to work with.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Make Your Changes</h3>
          <p>
            Create a new branch in your forked repository for your changes. This
            keeps your work organized and separate from the main branch.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <h3>Submit a Pull Request (PR)</h3>
          <p>
            When your changes are complete, submit a pull request from your
            branch to the main Xray Atlas repository. The maintainers will
            review your PR, provide feedback, and merge it once it's ready.
